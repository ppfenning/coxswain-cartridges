"""Autonomy policy: decide whether a write kind may auto-apply, or must be gated.

Pure. No I/O, no clock, no environment reads. Takes a ledger and a question,
returns a decision. That purity is the point — the rule that governs whether an
agent may write to a production system should be testable in-process, with no
network and no fixtures beyond plain data.

CONTRACT (implement against this; see docs/CLEAN-ROOM.md — write it fresh)

    autonomy_policy(kind, risk, ledger_rows, policy_config) -> "auto" | "propose"

    plan_tier(cartridge, *, surfaces, patterns) -> 0 | 1 | 2

Rules the implementation must honour:

1.  ramp: never    -> always "propose". No streak can graduate it.
    ramp: gated    -> always "propose".
    ramp: deferred -> "propose" until the eligible kinds have graduated.
    ramp: eligible -> may graduate.

2.  A kind graduates after `graduation_n` consecutive CLEAN outcomes for that
    (kind, risk) pair. Clean means: proposed, approved unedited, and applied.

3.  A single reversal — human edited it, refused it, or a post-hoc detector
    fired — resets the streak to zero and multiplies the bar for that kind by
    `regraduation_multiplier`.

4.  Streaks are scoped to a configuration. Rows recorded under a different
    cartridge hash, provider profile, or per-node model binding DO NOT COUNT.
    A track record earned under different rules is not a track record. The
    caller filters; this module must not silently accept unfiltered rows.

5.  `caps` bound how many of a kind may auto-apply in a single run, even once
    graduated. Exceeding the cap does not reset the streak; the overflow simply
    gets proposed.

6.  The principal in a ledger row is the GRAPH, never a person. This module
    measures whether a write kind is trustworthy, not whether someone is.

7.  A row MAY carry a `subject` — the finer-grained principal inside a kind,
    such as the runbook entry a `runbook_execute` row was following. Trust is
    earned per subject where the caller names one: a runbook entry that has
    been right forty times says nothing about the entry written yesterday.

8.  A row MAY carry `attempts` — how many build attempts a fix loop took before
    this outcome. A clean that took three tries proves the loop converged, not
    that the kind is trustworthy first-try, so it neither builds nor breaks a
    streak. The fix loop must never launder struggle into trust.

9.  Before a build there are no `change_facts`, only a task's `surfaces` and
    `patterns`. `plan_tier` reads `cartridge["policy"]["review_tier"]`: 2 if
    any surface is in `tier2_surfaces`, else 0 if any pattern is in
    `tier0_patterns`, else 1. A missing list reads as empty.

Unit tests for this file should need nothing but dicts and lists.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (decisions the contract left open)

Rule 4 says the caller filters and this module "must not silently accept
unfiltered rows". Silence is the part that matters: handed rows spanning more
than one `cartridge_sha` or `provider_profile`, this module RAISES rather than
averaging a streak across configurations that were never comparable. A policy
that quietly does the wrong thing with bad input is how an agent earns autonomy
it did not deserve.

`policy_config` is the resolved cartridge's `policy` block plus the things the
decision cannot be made without: `write_kinds` (to read the kind's ramp),
`applied_this_run` (to enforce caps), and — where the caller has one — the
current proposal's `subject` and `subject_new`. The documented four-argument
signature is preserved rather than growing keyword arguments for them.

Subject is a GRAIN, not a scope. `SCOPE_KEYS` and `_require_single_scope` are
untouched by rule 7: rows about two runbook entries under one cartridge sha are
perfectly comparable, they are just answers to different questions. So:

-   `subject_new` truthy -> PROPOSE, unconditionally, even for a kind that has
    graduated. A brand-new entry has no track record by definition, and entry
    creation is the moment where a wrong one is cheapest to catch.
-   `subject` present -> the streak and the bar for this (kind, risk) are
    counted over rows carrying THAT subject and no others. An entry with no
    history has streak 0, and proposes.
-   `subject` absent -> kind-level fallback, exactly as before: every row of
    that (kind, risk) counts, whatever subject it happens to carry. That means
    one bad entry's reversals weigh on a subject-less caller's bar. It is the
    correct direction of error — the fallback should be the strict reading.

The `deferred` ramp check stays kind-level regardless. It asks whether the
basics are trusted at all, which is a question about the taxonomy, not about
whichever entry is in front of us.
