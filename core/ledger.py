"""Append-only run ledger — the only persistent state, and the I/O edge.

CONTRACT (implement against this; see docs/CLEAN-ROOM.md — write it fresh)

    append(rows, path) -> None
    read(path) -> tuple[dict, ...]
    append_observation(row, path) -> None   # post-hoc detector hits

One JSON object per line. Append only; never rewrite history. A row records
what a graph proposed, what the human decided, and what actually happened:

    {run_id, ts, principal, kind, risk, outcome, cartridge_sha, provider_profile}

Three fields are optional, and absent means absent — never a written default,
because policy reads them and an invented value is an invented track record:

    subject   the finer-grained principal inside a kind, when the run had one:
              the runbook entry a `runbook_execute` row was following, say.
              Trust is earned per subject where one is named.
    attempts  how many build attempts the fix loop took before this outcome.
              Absent means first try, which is the only kind of clean that
              earns anything.
    model     the per-node model binding the proposing run was under. Rows
              lacking it are their own scope — pooled with each other, never
              with a row that names a model.

`outcome` is one of:
    clean     applied exactly as proposed
    reversal  the human edited or refused it
    skipped   approved but never executed
    failure   applied, then a detector found it was wrong

`principal` is the GRAPH name, never a person.

This module is deliberately tiny. Everything interesting is in policy.py, which
is pure and takes these rows as input.
