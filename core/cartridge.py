"""Cartridge loader and validator: resolve base + team into one merged config.

CONTRACT (implement against this; see docs/CLEAN-ROOM.md — write it fresh)

    load(team, cartridges_dir) -> dict

Merge semantics:

1.  A team cartridge declares `extends: <parent>`. Resolve the chain to the
    root, then deep-merge parent-under-child. Child wins on scalar conflicts.
2.  Within EACH layer of that chain, `<layer>/cartridge.d/*.yaml` fragments
    (sorted by filename) fold over that layer, after the layer has already
    been merged into the chain — so `base`'s fragments fold before `base`
    joins `local`, and a team's fragments fold last. Each fragment is
    checked against the ACCUMULATED authority at that point: the parent
    chain, then the layer's own `cartridge.yaml`, then every fragment
    folded before it — not against the layer alone, so a fragment adding a
    kind the layer's `cartridge.yaml` never mentioned is still checked
    against whatever the parent chain declared for it. A refusal names the
    fragment file, never the team.
3.  `context` lists CONCATENATE, base-first. A team pack refines a base
    principle; it does not replace it. Order is the reading order.
4.  Resolved `context` entries are ABSOLUTE paths. Graph scripts have no
    filesystem access — they pass paths to agent nodes, which read them.
5.  Emit `cartridge_dir` and `cartridge_sha` on the resolved dict. The sha
    covers the merged config AND every context pack's content AND every
    fragment's content: changing a charter, or a fragment, changes the
    hash, which resets autonomy streaks.
6.  `crew` is the canonical key for the seats mapping. `cast` is accepted as
    a deprecated alias for one release: a layer using it resolves exactly as
    `crew` would, and is named in the resolved dict's `deprecations` list.
    The resolved dict carries both `crew` and `cast` with the same value.

Validation — refuse to resolve, loudly, when:

-   a REQUIRED role from the base is unbound
-   a team TIGHTENS nothing but LOOSENS a risk or ramp the base declared
-   a bound skill name does not resolve to exactly one skill body
-   a context path does not exist
-   a write kind names an apply_arm role that is not bound
-   a layer declares both `cast` and `crew` for the seats mapping

Fail at load, never at run. A graph that discovers a missing binding halfway
through a production sweep has already done half the damage.

CLI: `python -m core.cartridge --team <name> --json` prints the resolved
cartridge, which is what a shell injects into a graph's `args.cartridge`.
There is deliberately no inline fallback anywhere in a graph — a fallback means
the seam never gets exercised and quietly rots.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (decisions the contract left open)

`skill_index` is a REQUIRED keyword argument, not an optional one. The contract
says resolution must refuse when a bound name does not resolve to exactly one
body; a default of `None` would make that check quietly skippable, which is the
precise failure mode this substrate exists to prevent. Build one with
`core.skills.index_from_roots`, or hand tests a plain dict.

`cartridge_sha` hashes the merged config with `context` EXCLUDED, then hashes
each context pack's bytes in resolved order, then each fragment's bytes in the
order they were folded. Context paths are absolute, so including them in the
hashed payload would make the sha depend on where the repo happens to be
checked out — every machine would compute a different hash and no autonomy
streak would ever survive moving a directory. Content is what matters, and
content is what is hashed.

A fragment's `context` entries resolve relative to the TEAM directory (the one
holding `cartridge.yaml`), not to `cartridge.d/` itself — a fragment is
additional declaration for that layer, not a nested cartridge with its own
base path. A fragment's `extends` key, if it has one, is silently ignored:
`_chain` resolves inheritance from each layer's `cartridge.yaml` before any
fragment is read, so by the time a fragment is folded in, the chain is
already fixed.

`_fold_fragments` is the one place fragments are folded and checked against an
authority; `load` only reads files (the layer's `cartridge.yaml` and its
`cartridge.d/*.yaml`) and calls it once per layer, so an illegal loosening is
reported exactly once no matter how many fragments led to it. An empty or
comment-only fragment file parses to `None`; it folds as `{}`, exactly as if
the file were absent, rather than being refused.
